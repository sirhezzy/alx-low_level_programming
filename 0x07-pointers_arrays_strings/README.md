## Task 1; 1. memcpy
- Write a function that copies memory area.

## Task 2; 2. strchr
- Write a function that locates a character in a string.

## Task 3; 3. strspn
- Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

## Task 4; 4. strpbrk
- Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

## Task 5; 5. strstr
- Write a function that locates a substring.

## Task 6; 6. Chess is mental torture
